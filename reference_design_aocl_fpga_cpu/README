=====
ABOUT
=====
A barebones opencl synthetic application.
Intended targets are:
CPU : Inter CPU 
AOCL: Altera FPGA (on BOLAMA)
This can be extended.


=============
REQUIREMENTS
=============

1. For Altera-OpenCL (AOCL), you need the aoc compiler and appropriate licenses. This code has been tested with aocl/15.1, with OpenCL 1.2, on bolama@glasgow

2. For Intel CPU targets, you need Intel's OpenCL drivers and runtime installed, with OpenCL version 2.1. You can get it from here:
https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/opencl-drivers#latest_linux_SDK_release

=====
BUILD
=====

CPU (HOST-ONLY) TARGET
-----------------------

/1/
if using modules, make sure AOCL is *unloaded*, e.g.:
> module unload aocl/15.1

/2/
a) baseline (no channels):
> cd build_CPU
> make
> ./host.exe

b) channelized:
> cd build_CPU
> make CHANNELS=1
> ./host.exe

ALTERA-OCL
----------
/1/
if using modules, make sure AOCL is loaded, e.g.:
> module load aocl/15.1


/2/
a) baseline (no channels):
cd build_AOCL
. ./build_and_run_emu.sh (for emulation)
. ./build_and_run_hw.sh  (for full hardware sythesis) 

b) channelized:
cd build_AOCL
. ./build_and_run_emu_channels.sh (for emulation)
. ./build_and_run_hw_channels     (for full hardware sythesis)
